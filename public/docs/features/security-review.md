# Code security reviews

## What's the risk?

AI assistants are powerful productivity tools to generate, improve, fix, and
explain complex application code. However, AI models rarely incorporate secure
coding practices as a primary consideration in their responses. This can expose
your application to vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting
(XSS), remote command execution (RCE), and more.

## How CodeGate helps

CodeGate performs security-centric code reviews, flagging insecure patterns or
potential vulnerabilities and helping you adhere to secure coding practices.

## How it works

When you include mention `codegate` or `security` in a chat prompt, CodeGate
enhances the response with security-centric recommendations and code
suggestions.
