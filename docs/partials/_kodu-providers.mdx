:::info Known issues

There is currently a known issue using Claude Coder with CodeGate muxing. We are
[working on a fix](https://github.com/stacklok/codegate/pull/1003) which we
expect to release in CodeGate v0.1.19.

:::

First, configure your [provider(s)](../features/muxing.md#add-a-provider) and
select a model for each of your
[workspace(s)](../features/workspaces.mdx#manage-workspaces) in the CodeGate
dashboard.

In the **Provider Settings** settings, select **OpenAI Compatible**. Set the
**Base URL** to `http://localhost:8989/v1/mux`.

Enter anything you want into the Model ID and API key fields; these are not used
since the actual provider and model is determined by your CodeGate workspace.

<TabItem value="openai" label="OpenAI">

You need an [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/api/) account to use this provider.
To use a different OpenAI-compatible endpoint, set the `CODEGATE_OPENAI_URL`
[configuration parameter](../how-to/configure.md) when you launch CodeGate.

In the **Provider Settings** settings, select **OpenAI Compatible**. Set the
**Base URL** to `http://localhost:8989/openai`.

Enter the **Model ID** and your
[OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). A reasoning model like
`o1-mini` or `o3-mini` is recommended.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="openrouter" label="OpenRouter">

You need an [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) account to use this provider.

In the **Provider Settings** settings, select **OpenAI Compatible**. Set the
**Base URL** to `http://localhost:8989/openrouter`.

Enter your [preferred model](https://openrouter.ai/models) for the **Model ID**
(example: `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`) and add your
[OpenRouter API key](https://openrouter.ai/keys).
