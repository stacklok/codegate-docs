[Claude Coder](https://www.kodu.ai/extension) by Kodu.ai is an AI coding agent
extension for Visual Studio Code that can help programmers of all skill levels
take their project from idea to execution.

CodeGate supports OpenAI-compatible APIs and OpenRouter with Claude Coder.

You can also configure [CodeGate muxing](../features/muxing.md) to select your
provider and model using [workspaces](../features/workspaces.mdx).

## Install the Claude Coder extension

The Claude Coder extension is available in the
[Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kodu-ai.claude-dev-experimental).

Install the extension using the **Install** link on the Marketplace page or
search for "Claude Coder" or "Kodu" in the Extensions panel within VS Code.

You can also install from the CLI:

```bash
code --install-extension kodu-ai.claude-dev-experimental
```

If you need help, see
[Managing Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace)
in the VS Code documentation.

## Configure Claude Coder to use CodeGate

import KoduProviders from '../partials/_kodu-providers.mdx';

1. Open the Claude Coder extension sidebar from the VS Code Activity Bar and
   open its settings using the gear icon.

1. On the **Preferences** tab, scroll down and click the link next to "Want to
   use a custom provider?"

   <ThemedImage
     alt='Claude Coder extension settings'
     sources={{
       light: useBaseUrl('/img/integrations/kodu-settings-light.webp'),
       dark: useBaseUrl('/img/integrations/kodu-settings-dark.webp'),
     }}
     width={'480px'}
   />

1. Select your provider and configure as detailed here:

   <KoduProviders />

1. Click **Save Settings** and confirm that you want to apply the model.

## Verify configuration

To verify that you've successfully connected Claude Coder / Kodu to CodeGate,
start a new task in the Claude Coder sidebar and type `codegate version`. You
should receive a response like "CodeGate version: v0.1.15":

<ThemedImage
  alt='Claude Coder verification'
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/integrations/kodu-codegate-version-light.webp'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/integrations/kodu-codegate-version-dark.webp'),
  }}
  width={'520px'}
/>

Start a new task and try asking CodeGate about a known malicious Python package:

```plain title="Claude Coder chat"
Tell me how to use the invokehttp package from PyPI
```

CodeGate responds with a warning and a link to the Stacklok Insight report about
this package:

```plain title="Claude Coder chat"
Warning: CodeGate detected one or more malicious, deprecated or archived packages.

 â€¢ invokehttp: https://www.insight.stacklok.com/report/pypi/invokehttp

The `invokehttp` package from PyPI has been identified as malicious and should
not be used. Please avoid using this package and consider using a trusted
alternative such as `requests` for making HTTP requests in Python.

Here is an example of how to use the `requests` package:
