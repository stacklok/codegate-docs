[Aider](https://aider.chat/) is an open source AI coding assistant that lets you
pair program with LLMs in your terminal.

CodeGate works with the following AI model providers through aider:

- Local / self-managed:
  - [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
- Hosted:
  - [OpenAI](https://openai.com/api/) and OpenAI-compatible APIs

You can also configure [CodeGate muxing](../features/muxing.md) to select your
provider and model using [workspaces](../features/workspaces.mdx).

:::note

This guide assumes you have already installed aider using their
[installation instructions](https://aider.chat/docs/install.html).
