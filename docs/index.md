## What is CodeGate?

CodeGate is a local prompt gateway that sits between your AI coding assistant
and LLM to enhance privacy and security. CodeGate performs code security
reviews, identifies vulnerabilities in package dependencies, and prevents
sensitive data like secrets from being shared with AI models.

    Client ->> CodeGate: Prompt
    activate CodeGate
    CodeGate ->> LLM: Enhanced prompt

```

## Key features

CodeGate includes several key features for privacy, security, and coding
efficiency, including:

- [Secrets encryption and PII redaction](./features/secrets-encryption.md) to
  protect your sensitive credentials and anonymize personally identifiable
  information
- [Dependency risk awareness](./features/dependency-risk.md) to update the LLM's
  knowledge of malicious or deprecated open source packages
- [Model muxing](./features/muxing.mdx) to quickly select the best LLM
  provider/model for your current task
- [Workspaces](./features/workspaces.mdx) to organize and customize your LLM
  interactions

## Supported environments

CodeGate supports several development environments and AI providers.

AI coding assistants / IDEs:

- **[Aider](./integrations/aider.mdx)** with Ollama and OpenAI-compatible APIs

- **[Cline](./integrations/cline.mdx)** in Visual Studio Code

  CodeGate supports Ollama, Anthropic, OpenAI and compatible APIs, OpenRouter,
  and LM Studio with Cline

- **[Continue](./integrations/continue.mdx)** with Visual Studio Code and
  JetBrains IDEs

  CodeGate supports the following AI model providers with Continue:

  - Local / self-managed: Ollama, llama.cpp, vLLM
  - Hosted: Anthropic, OpenAI and compatible APIs, and OpenRouter

- **[GitHub Copilot](./integrations/copilot.mdx)** with Visual Studio Code
  (JetBrains coming soon!)

- **[Kodu / Claude Coder](./integrations/kodu.mdx)** in Visual Studio Code with
  OpenAI-compatible APIs

- **[Open Interpreter](./integrations/open-interpreter.mdx)** with
  OpenAI-compatible APIs

We're continuing to add more AI assistants/agents and model providers based on
community feedback.
