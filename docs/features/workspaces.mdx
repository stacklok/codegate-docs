## Overview

_Workspaces_ in CodeGate allow you to organize and customize your interactions
with large language models (LLMs). Each workspace is a distinct environment with
its own configuration and history, enabling personalized settings and efficient
management of your projects or tasks.

Examples might include workspaces for different projects you're working on, or
for specific tasks like code reviews or generating documentation. You can add
custom instructions to each workspace to customize its behavior suitable to the
task at hand.

## Key features

Workspaces offer several key features:

- **Custom instructions**: Customize your interactions with LLMs by augmenting
  your AI assistant's system prompt, enabling tailored responses and behaviors
  for different types of tasks.

- **Prompt and alert history**: Your LLM interactions (prompt history) and
  CodeGate security detections (alert history) are recorded in the active
  workspace, allowing you to track and review past interactions.

- **Isolation**: Configurations and data in one workspace do not affect others,
  providing clarity when reviewing your AI-assisted coding history and precision
  in tailoring your custom instructions.

:::tip Recommendations

- Use workspaces to separate different projects or objectives, with customized
  instructions to optimize your work in each focus area.
- Switch your active workspace as you move between projects or tasks. This helps
  you maintain your prompt and alert history for each project.
- Regularly review and update your custom instructions to align with the
  evolving needs of your projects.

## Working with workspaces

You can view and manage your workspaces from the
[CodeGate dashboard](../how-to/dashboard.md)
([http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)) or using commands in your AI
assistant's chat interface.

:::info Default workspace

CodeGate ships with a default workspace named `default`. This workspace cannot
be renamed, archived, or deleted.

:::

Only one workspace is active at any one time, and all AI assistant interactions
occur within that workspace.

You can perform several actions on workspaces:

- **Activate**: Activate a workspace for use. Only one workspace can be active
  at a time.
- **Add**: Create a new workspace.
- **Rename**: Change the name of a workspace.
- **Custom instructions**: Add custom instructions to augment your AI
  assistant's system prompt.
- **Archive**: Mark a workspace as archived without permanently deleting it. The
  workspace is hidden from the available workspaces list, but can be restored
  later. This is useful when you are not actively working on a project but may
  want to come back to it in the future.
- **Delete**: Permanently delete an archived workspace (CLI only).

## Manage workspaces using the dashboard

### Select the active workspace

The currently active workspace is displayed at the top of the CodeGate dashboard
interface. You can change the active workspace by expanding the workspace
drop-down menu. Select the workspace you want to activate. You can also search
by name to quickly find the desired workspace.

  }}

### Manage workspaces

To manage all your workspaces, select **Manage Workspaces** in the workspace
menu.

Click **Create Workspace** to add a new workspace. Workspace names can contain
alphanumeric characters, hyphens (`-`), and underscores (`_`). Names are
converted to lowercase, and must be unique.

In the workspace list, click the **Settings** button next to a workspace to open
the workspace settings screen. From here you can rename the workspace, set the
custom prompt instructions, or archive the workspace. Archived workspaces can be
restored from the Manage Workspaces screen, or permanently deleted
[using the CLI](#delete).

## Manage workspaces using the chat CLI

You can manage workspaces using `codegate workspace` commands sent through your
AI assistant's chat interface. To see all available commands, run:

```text
codegate workspace -h
```

### Create a workspace \{#add}

To create a new workspace:

```text
codegate workspace add WORKSPACE_NAME
```

Replace `WORKSPACE_NAME` with a name for the new workspace. Names can only
contain alphanumeric characters, hyphens (`-`), and underscores (`_`).

### List workspaces \{#list}

Get a list of all non-archived workspaces:

```text
codegate workspace list
```

The currently active workspace is indicated as **(active)** in the list.

### Activate a workspace \{#activate}

Switch between workspaces using the `activate` command. The active workspace is
the current environment for commands and configuration.

```text
codegate workspace activate WORKSPACE_NAME
```

Replace `WORKSPACE_NAME` with the name of the workspace to activate.

### Customize the system prompt \{#custom-instructions}

To add custom instructions to your system prompt:

```text
codegate custom-instructions [-w WORKSPACE_NAME] set SYSTEM_PROMPT
```

Replace `SYSTEM_PROMPT` with your custom prompt text. Optionally, specify the
workspace to modify with `-w WORKSPACE_NAME`. If you don't explicitly set a
workspace, the currently active workspace is modified.

**Example**: Set a custom system prompt for the workspace named "project-alpha":

```text
codegate custom-instructions -w project-alpha set Start each conversation with "Welcome to Project Alpha Assistant. How can I help today?"
```

To show the current custom instructions on a workspace:

```text
codegate custom-instructions [-w WORKSPACE_NAME] show
```

To reset (clear) the custom instructions for a workspace:

```text
codegate custom-instructions [-w WORKSPACE_NAME] reset
```

### Rename a workspace \{#rename}

To change the name of an existing workspace:

```text
codegate workspace rename WORKSPACE_NAME NEW_WORKSPACE_NAME
```

Replace `WORKSPACE_NAME` with the current name of the workspace, and
`NEW_WORKSPACE_NAME` with the new name to set.

### Archive a workspace \{#archive}

To archive a workspace:

```text
codegate workspace archive WORKSPACE_NAME
```

Replace `WORKSPACE_NAME` with the name of the workspace to archive. You cannot
archive the currently active workspace. Archived workspaces can be
[restored](#restore) later or [permanently deleted](#delete).

### List archived workspaces \{#list-archived}

Get a list of all archived workspaces:

```text
codegate workspace list-archived
```

Archived workspaces can be [restored](#restore) or
[permanently deleted](#delete), but cannot be activated.

### Restore an archived workspace \{#restore}

Use the `restore` command to recover an [archived](#archive) workspace. Once
restored, a workspace will appear in your available [workspace list](#list) and
can be [activated](#activate).

```text
codegate workspace restore WORKSPACE_NAME
```

Replace `WORKSPACE_NAME` with the name of the workspace to restore.

### Permanently delete a workspace \{#delete}

The `delete-archived` command permanently deletes an archived workspace.

```text
codegate workspace delete-archived WORKSPACE_NAME
```

Replace `WORKSPACE_NAME` with the name of the workspace to delete.

:::warning

Deletion is permanent. Ensure that the workspace is no longer needed and can be
safely removed.
