[Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline) is an autonomous coding agent for Visual
Studio Code that supports numerous API providers and models.

CodeGate works with the following AI model providers through Cline:

- Local / self-managed:
  - [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
  - [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)
- Hosted:
  - [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/api)
  - [OpenAI](https://openai.com/api/) and OpenAI-compatible APIs

## Install the Cline extension

The Cline extension is available in the
[Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=saoudrizwan.claude-dev).

Install the extension using the **Install** link on the Marketplace page or
search for "Cline" in the Extensions panel within VS Code.

You can also install from the CLI:

```bash
code --install-extension saoudrizwan.claude-dev
```

If you need help, see
[Managing Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace)
in the VS Code documentation.

## Configure Cline to use CodeGate

import ClineProviders from '../partials/_cline-providers.mdx';

To configure Cline to send requests through CodeGate:

1. Open the Cline extension sidebar from the VS Code Activity Bar and open its
   settings using the gear icon.

   <ThemedImage
     alt='Cline extension settings'
     sources={{
       light: useBaseUrl('/img/how-to/cline-settings-light.webp'),
       dark: useBaseUrl('/img/how-to/cline-settings-dark.webp'),
     }}
     width={'540px'}
   />

1. Select your provider and configure as detailed here:

   <ClineProviders />

1. Click **Done** to save the settings.

## Verify configuration

To verify that you've successfully connected Cline to CodeGate, open the Cline
sidebar and type `codegate version`. You should receive a response like
"CodeGate version 0.1.14":

<ThemedImage
  alt='Cline verification'
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/how-to/cline-codegate-version-light.webp'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/how-to/cline-codegate-version-dark.webp'),
  }}
  width={'490px'}
/>

Try asking CodeGate about a known malicious Python package:

```plain title="Cline chat"
Tell me how to use the invokehttp package from PyPI
```

CodeGate responds with a warning and a link to the Stacklok Insight report about
this package:

```plain title="Cline chat"
Warning: CodeGate detected one or more malicious, deprecated or archived packages.

 â€¢ invokehttp: https://www.insight.stacklok.com/report/pypi/invokehttp

The `invokehttp` package from PyPI has been identified as malicious and should
not be used. Please avoid using this package and consider using a trusted
alternative such as `requests` for making HTTP requests in Python.

Here is an example of how to use the `requests` package:
