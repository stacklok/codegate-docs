## Verify configuration

To verify that you've successfully connected Copilot to CodeGate, open the
Copilot chat and type `codegate-version`. You should receive a response like
this:

```plan
Codegate version: 0.1.0
```

Try asking CodeGate about a known malicious Python package:

```plain

CodeGate responds with a warning and a link to the Stacklok Insight report about

Warning: CodeGate detected one or more malicious or archived packages.

Package: https://insight.stacklok.com/pypi/invokehttp
