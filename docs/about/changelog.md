- **UI port change** - 7 Jan, 2025\
  The internal port for the dashboard UI has changed from 80 to 9090 to resolve
  a permissions issue for Linux users.

- **Semantic versioning for container image** - 29 Dec, 2024\
  CodeGate is now using semantic versioning for the container image, tied to
  GitHub releases. We'll continue to highlight major features and changes here,
  but to review all updates, see the
  [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/stacklok/codegate/releases).\
  CodeGate is evolving quickly, so we still recommend pulling the `latest` tag
  so you don't miss out on new features and improvements.

- **Introducing CodeGate** - 17 Dec, 2024\
