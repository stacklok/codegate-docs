### Does CodeGate replace my AI coding assistant or agent?

No, CodeGate works _with_ your AI coding tool, as a local intermediary between
your client and the LLM it's communicating with.

### Does CodeGate work with any other IDE plugins or coding assistants?

We are actively exploring additional integrations based on user feedback.
[Join the community on Discord](https://discord.gg/stacklok) to let us know
about your favorite AI coding tool!

In theory, any tool that supports one of CodeGate's provider API endpoints
should work, however we have encountered many edge cases depending on how the AI
assistants and agents format their prompts and expect their responses, so your
mileage may vary.

### Don't AI coding tools already redact secrets for me?

It may be surprising to learn that AI coding tools don't redact secrets for you.
Through packet captures and logging, we've seen these tools routinely sending
secrets and PII to remote LLM providers as they collect file contents to use as
context.

### Can I use CodeGate without an internet connection?

Yes, CodeGate can be used without an internet connection as long as you have a
local LLM server running. CodeGate is designed to work with local providers like
Ollama, LM Studio, and vLLM. Once you have downloaded the container image,
CodeGate has no external dependencies and can be run entirely offline.

### How do I know if I'm running the latest version of CodeGate?

The CodeGate dashboard includes a version update check which will alert you if a
new version is available. You can also check the latest version of CodeGate on
our [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/stacklok/codegate/releases). To
upgrade, see the [upgrade instructions](../how-to/install.mdx#upgrade-codegate)
in the installation guide.

### What kind of support is available for CodeGate?
