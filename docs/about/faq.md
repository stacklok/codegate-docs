:::

### Does CodeGate replace my AI code assistant plugin?

No, CodeGate works _with_ your AI code assistant, as a local gateway between
your client and the LLM it's communicating with.

### Does CodeGate work with any plugins other than Copilot and Continue?

Currently, CodeGate works with GitHub Copilot and Continue. We are actively
exploring additional integrations based on user feedback.
