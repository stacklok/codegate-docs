### Does CodeGate replace my AI coding assistant or agent?

No, CodeGate works _with_ your AI coding tool, as a local intermediary between
your client and the LLM it's communicating with.

### Does CodeGate work with any other IDE plugins or coding assistants?

We are actively exploring additional integrations based on user feedback.
